## OxyPlot charts working example

I went through a lot of problems when trying to compile a working WPF application with OxyPlot. To maybe save some problems to other programmers, I am publishing this.

There were some examples available, but many of more complex-ones were not compiling with newest version of OxyPlot.Wpf NuGet package.

## Steps

1. Created plain WPF application
2. Through NuGet packet manager I added OxyPlot.Wpf package (don't forget "Include prerelease" tick when searching)
